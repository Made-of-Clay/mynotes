# Investing

I will be collecting notes on investing and testing the waters to determine if I want to expand into this more than I currently am. This is largely prompted by April encouraging me to look into it more. It is kind of a good bonding opportunity too and a potentially interesting topic. The most interesting thing, from Phil Town's *Rule #1* book, at least, is the research required determining whether a company is good for me. I like the research hunt and aggregation of information in general. We'll see if I like it in this context as well.
