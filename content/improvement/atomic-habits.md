# Atomic Habits

Inspired and quoting the book by the same name, *Atomic Habits*, by James Clear, outlines the importance that small, incremental changes make over the long-haul.

## The Fundamentals: Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

### The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

> ... if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero.
> <br>1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03
> <br>1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78 (19)

> Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. (20)

> Your outcomes are a lagging effect of your habits. (21)

When considering these ideas, it is important to remember that considering "self-improvement" or "self help," not to let the "self" be over-emphasized. The real focus is the outcome, not the self. Mastery over a skill of knowledge of a subject is the real treasure. Self is simply the subject referent.

> Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. (23)

> *Plateau of Latent Potential* - the point after which seemingly unproductive habits begin producing noticeable results

Clear says that, while goals help point one in a direction, the systems used to reach those goals are the real progress-makers. Goals are good, but they don't make progress (consider New Year's resolutions pertaining to the gym or some other "goal" for the new year). He lists problems with too much time focused on goals and not enough on systems:

1. Winners and losers have the same goals

> "It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome."

2. Achieving a goal is only a momentary change

> We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results.

3. Goals restrict your happiness

This becomes a very "it's about the journey, not the destination" thing. Only being happy with accomplishing goals and not the system that is between those points of time has obvious draw-backs.

4. Goals are at odds with long-term progress

Accomplishing goals motivates, but once accomplished, the motivation is lost. A system continues after some goal is met or achievement earned.

> It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.

> You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

**End Note:** these chapters end in summaries; read the title, subtitles, and summary before reading the chapter to really gain an idea of what's up. The content is a bit fluffy though, so no need to read every word. Just find the good stuff.
