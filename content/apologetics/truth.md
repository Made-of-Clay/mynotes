# Truth

Is there such a thing as truth? Is your truth different from my truth, or is that something else? Can truth be objectively known *if* it exists? These questions are epistemological and deal with that is knowable and how one can be certain it is known.

TODO Flesh out this section - start with how truth can be known, what role reason and logic play, etc....
