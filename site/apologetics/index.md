# Apologetics

At the time of building this website (June 2020), I am half-way through my study through the [Liberty University Master of Arts in Christian Apologetics](https://www.liberty.edu/residential/divinity/masters/christian-apologetics/) program. This section of notes is intended to help me organize critical notes and understand the robust nature of the available defenses for the Christian faith.

> But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect...
> <br>-1 Peter 3:15

> It's no longer enough to teach our children Bible stories; they need doctrine and apologetics.
> <br>- William Lane Craig

> I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.
> <br>- C. S. Lewis

> Little science takes you away from God, but more of it takes you to Him.
> <br>- Louis Pasteur
